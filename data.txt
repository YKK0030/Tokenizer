In the dense jungles of Borneo, a rare species of orchid blooms only once every seven years, releasing a scent that mimics rotting fruit to attract flies for pollination. Meanwhile, scientists studying deep-sea hydrothermal vents recently discovered a bacteria strain that metabolizes iron and emits a faint bluish glow, possibly hinting at alternative life chemistries. In an entirely unrelated field, urban planners in Helsinki are experimenting with heated sidewalks powered by excess data center heat, aiming to reduce winter slip-and-fall accidents. Simultaneously, AI models are being trained on whale song patterns to decode potential communication structures, drawing surprising parallels to early human dialects.
